The bot is extremely simple .
First you need to download the
required modules , such as :
pip install psutil , pip
install python - dotenv , pip
install pyTelegramBotAPI . If
I missed something sorry , this
is my first projects . The
bot was made with AI ,
such issues as database and
other small issues were solved
with a neural network .
